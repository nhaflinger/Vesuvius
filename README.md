# Vesuvius

## Description
Vesuvius is a Navier Stokes solver for gas dynamic simulations for computer graphics. Currently it lacks the third-party integration tools it would need for use in a computer graphics production environment. It is intended primarily for education purposes.

## Features
* Multi-threading 
* OpenVDB support for emitters, colliders and simulation output
* Support for a variety of particle tracing and advection modes
* Support for both linear and cubic interpolation
* Vorticity confinement
* Procedural turbulence (curl noise)
* Procedural noise on emission objects
